              Many of the broadsides published were songs and poems. As the
              traditional minstrel declined in popularity, publishing broadsides
              containing songs and poems grew more popular. Songs in the
              broadsides were published to existing Scottish tunes or to new
              tunes written for the new song. Most ballads were sung by hawkers,
              or street traders, who were selling the broadsides. When the
              majority of the population at the time couldnâ€™t read, songs and
              poems were a way of sharing information and news without having to
              read. Famous writers and poets, such as Robert Burns, sometimes
              wrote poems and songs for the broadsides, but most were written by
              unknown authors. Below we have produced some summary
              visualisations about the topic of songs in the broadsides and the
              most commonly used words.
